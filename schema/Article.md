# Examples

## Simple

In its most basic form, an `Article` requires a `title` and a list of `authors`.

```json import=simple
{
  "type": "Article",
  "title": "Recherches sur les substances radioactives",
  "authors": [
    {
      "type": "Person",
      "honorificPrefix": "Dr",
      "givenNames": ["Marie", "Skłodowska"],
      "familyNames": ["Curie"],
      "honorificSuffix": "PhD"
    }
  ],
  "content": [
    "Le présent travail a pour but d'exposer les recherches que je poursuis depuis"
  ]
}
```

## More Complex

In addition to the properties demonstrated above, `content` is usually a key property to most articles. The `content` property contains a list of [`Node`s](/schema/Node), meaning it can be contain any other valid node type.

```json import=complex
{
  "type": "Article",
  "title": "Introducing eLife’s first computationally reproducible article",
  "url": "https://elifesciences.org/labs/ad58f08d/introducing-elife-s-first-computationally-reproducible-article",
  "authors": ["Giuliano Maciocci", "Michael Aufreiter", "Nokome Bentley"],
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "Paragraph",
      "content": [
        "In September 2017 eLife announced the start of the Reproducible Document Stack (RDS) project, a collaboration between Substance, Stencila and eLife to support the development of an open-source technology stack aimed at enabling researchers to publish reproducible manuscripts through online journals. Reproducible manuscripts enrich the traditional narrative of a research article with code, data and interactive figures that can be executed in the browser, downloaded and explored, giving readers a direct insight into the methods, algorithms and key data behind the published research."
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "Paragraph",
      "content": [
        "Today eLife, in collaboration with ",
        {
          "type": "Link",
          "target": "http://substance.io/",
          "content": ["Substance"]
        },
        ", ",
        {
          "type": "Link",
          "target": "https://stenci.la/",
          "content": ["Stencila"]
        },
        " and Tim Errington, Director of Research ar the Center for Open Science, US, published its ",
        {
          "type": "Link",
          "target": "https://elifesci.org/reproducible-example",
          "content": ["first reproducible article"]
        },
        ", based on one of Errington’s papers in the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology. This reproducible version of the article showcases some of what’s possible with the new RDS tools, and we invite researchers to explore the newly available opportunities to tell their story."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Encodings

This section describes common encodings for this node type. These samples are generated from the above examples by [Encoda](https://stencila.github.io/encoda), but you can also author them in each format.
:::

These examples, based on [Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie), illustrate alternative ways for specifying an `Article`.

## JATS

`Article` is analogous, and structurally similar to, the JATS [`<article>`](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/articleauthoring/tag-library/1.2/element/article.html) element:

> A journal article `<article>` may be divided into three parts:
>
> 1.  the `<front>` (the metadata or header information for the article, such as the title and the published date);
> 2.  the `<body>` (textual and graphical content of the article); and
> 3.  any `<back>` (ancillary information such as a glossary, reference list, or appendix).

In JATS the `<body>` element is the "Main textual portion of the document that conveys the narrative content."

### JATS Simple Example

## mdast

`Article.body` is analogous to the mdast [`Root`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#root) node type which "represents a document":

> Root can be used as the root of a tree, never as a child. Its content model is not limited to top-level content, but can contain any content with the restriction that all content must be of the same category.

In September 2017 eLife announced the start of the Reproducible Document Stack (RDS) project, a collaboration between Substance, Stencila and eLife to support the development of an open-source technology stack aimed at enabling researchers to publish reproducible manuscripts through online journals. Reproducible manuscripts enrich the traditional narrative of a research article with code, data and interactive figures that can be executed in the browser, downloaded and explored, giving readers a direct insight into the methods, algorithms and key data behind the published research.

Today eLife, in collaboration with [Substance](http://substance.io/), [Stencila](https://stenci.la/) and Tim Errington, Director of Research ar the Center for Open Science, US, published its [first reproducible article](https://elifesci.org/reproducible-example), based on one of Errington’s papers in the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology. This reproducible version of the article showcases some of what’s possible with the new RDS tools, and we invite researchers to explore the newly available opportunities to tell their story.

## OpenDocument

`Article` is analogous to the OpenDocument `<office:document>` element is the root element in a single**\*** OpenDocument XML document:

> The [`<office:document>`](http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/OpenDocument-v1.2-os-part1.html#__RefHeading__1414998_253892949) element is the root element of a document in OpenDocument format which is represented as a single XML document. It contains the entire document.

A `<office:document>` has child elements,

- meta-data related `<office:meta>`, `<office:settings>`
- styles etc `<office:scripts>`, `<office:font-face-decls>`, `<office:styles>`, `<office:automatic-styles>`, `<office:master-styles>`
- content `<office:body>`

`Article.body` is analogous to `<office:body>` which can have child elements like `<office:drawing>`, `<office:presentation>`, `<office:spreadsheet>`, `<office:text>`. The primary difference is that `Article.body` can only contain named `Sheet`s (which themselves contain text or spreadsheet type documents).

Other properties of `Article` are analogous to those in [`<office:meta>`](http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/OpenDocument-v1.2-os-part1.html#__RefHeading__1415014_253892949).

**\***: In a multi-XML document OpenDocument properties are group together e.g. content in `<office:document-content>` and styles in `<office:document-styles>`.
