:::

A part of a successively published publication such as a periodical or publication volume, often numbered, usually
containing a grouping of works such as articles. In reproducible documents, [`Articles`](./Article.html) can reference
a `PublicationIssue` for bibliographical/citation purposes.

# Examples

An example of an issue of the journal Nature is below. Note that the issue has an `issueNumber` and `isPartOf` a volume
that, in turn, `isPartOf` the [`Periodical`](./Periodical.html) with the title "Nature".
