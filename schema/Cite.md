:::

A `Cite` node is used within a [`CreativeWork`](./CreativeWork.html), usually an [`Article`](./Article.html), to refer to an other `CreativeWork`. Often a `Cite` will be associated with other citations, in a [`CiteGroup`](./CiteGroup.html).

# Examples

The following example of a (very) short article, shows how a `Cite` is used to refer to another `Article` in the article's `references`.

```json import=ex1

    }

        }
