$comment: |
  This type exists mainly to have a more simple base class than schema.org's `Thing`.
  This schema includes special properties that are analagours to JSON-LDs `@type` and `@id`,
  as well as a `meta` property that can be used by applications for ad-hoc extensions.
properties:
  type:
    # This is a special property analogous to JSON-LD's `@type` keyword.
    # It is extended with the titles of all descendant types during
    # the generation of schema.json files.
    '@id': schema:type
    description: The name of the type.
    type: string
    enum: [Entity]
    default: Entity
  id:
    # This is a special property analogous to JSON-LD's `@id` keyword.
    '@id': schema:id
    description: The identifier for this item.
    type: string
  meta:
    # This property has been added to allow for tools that
    # use this schema to add experimental, ad-hoc properties to
    # entities.
    # Ad-hoc properties that become commonly used may become part of
    # the schema proper.
