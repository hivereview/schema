# The recommended way to serve JSON-LD is with "Cool URIs"
# and content negotiation. eg. this is how schema.org does it:
#   curl http://schema.org/Person -H "Accept:application/ld+json" -i
# Netlify does not support content negotiation
# (i.e. redirects based on the Accept header)
# Therefore, to provide a URL that fits with
# the norms for JSON-LD (no file extensions),
# we need to provide a specific route.

  from = "/jsonld/*"

# Redirect to unpkg
# Why? Because for the version redirects below
# unpkg redirects to an expanded, but relative, URL
# which Netlify thinks it should serve e.g:
#   > curl --silent --head https://unpkg.com/@stencila/schema@0/dist/CodeChunk.schema.json | grep Location
#   Location: /@stencila/schema@0.32.3/dist/CodeChunk.schema.json
# So this redirects back to unpkg:
[[redirects]]
  from = "/@stencila/*"
  to = "https://unpkg.com/@stencila/:splat"
  force = true

# Version redirects
# These redirect intentionally use http, instead of https,
# because that causes
# Unfortunately, given the current URL pattern `v1` etc,
# we can't make this work using placeholders
# (i.e. using `v:number`; placeholders must come after a slash).
# So more redirects for new versions will need to be added in
# the future.
